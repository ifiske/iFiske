## Quick start

### Building locally

Install NodeJS using your preferred method. You will also need `npm`, which usually is installed when installing node.

Make sure to use at least NodeJS v8 and npm v5. Using the most recent version is recommended.
You can not use `yarn` if you want to build with cordova, so using `npm` is recommended.

```Shell
git clone https://github.com/ifiske/ifiske.git
cd ifiske
npm install
npm start
```

### Deploying

Make sure that you are logged in to [Ionic Pro](https://dashboard.ionicjs.com) and have configured the git access correctly.

#### Bump version

Run `npm run deploy` in order to do a `major`, `minor` or `patch` bump.

Usually you should bump `patch`, but if you have changed the native cordova plugins, you should bump `minor`.

#### Build the code on Ionic Pro

The code should build automatically on Ionic Pro. When the build has finished you can trigger a native build if you made any changes to the native cordova plugins.

#### IMPORTANT: Set up the version information

Make sure to set up the version information correctly in the dashboard.

Set minimum to the latest compatible release (usually the latest minor release).

Set Maximum and Equivalent to the version number you are deploying.

#### Test your changes using Developer Mode

Enable Developer Mode and install the latest `Master` channel deploy.
Make sure everything seems OK.

#### Deploy to Production

If everything seems OK, deploy to the `Production` channel in the dashboard.
